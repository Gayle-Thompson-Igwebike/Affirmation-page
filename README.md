# Affirmation-page
My first ever Buddy-Group-Project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
The project requirements was to create a webpage that served a universal purpose or solved a universal problem.
We decided to create an affirmation page with motivational quotes for students, to help them navigate their studies during difficult and mentally challenging times.
We used HTML, CSS and Javascript to create our project.
The project wireframe created 3 pages which we divided between the 3 members of the team.
We made sure to contribute fairly to the project by constantly meeting and helping each other unblock any blockers and hindrances.
The taem worked great together, resolving conflicts and mitigating any issues.
The project was succesfully completed and deplyed using netlify.
